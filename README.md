## Factors Influencing Total Mercury in the hair of Kuwaiti

### INTRODUCTION
  As we all know, mercury is a poisonous pollutant to environment. For human being, mercury is a powerful neurotoxin. Nowadays, lots of human activities increase mercury content of environment, for instance, metal combustion, ore milling and etc. Various pollutants are getting involved in food chain and potentially doing harm to our health. Since mercury can be remaining in the hair and our hair almost has no process of metabolism for any elements in our body. Therefore, hair is a good way to measure the level of mercury containing in body. Because environment pollution and food safety have been hot issues these days. I decided to learn this topic for the final project.
  
  The data I used for analysis is **“Factors Influencing the Total Mercury and Methyl Mercury in the Hair of Fisherman in Kuwait”** (*N.B. Al-Majed and M.R. Preston, 2000*). There are n = 135 observations collected from a group of Kuwaiti fisherman and a control group of non-fisherman in the data set. Since **Methyl Mercury(mg/g)** is included in the **(TotHg)Total Mercury(mg/g)**, there will be some functional relationship between these two variables. Therefore, Total Mercury containing in the hair of Kuwaiti will be the response variable(Yi) of the regression model. Also, I guess the following variables are the **explanatory variables**.
  
- X1(fisherman): Fisherman which indicates whether he’s a fisherman or not;
- X2(age): Age(years) ranging from 16 - 58 years old;
- X3(restime): Residence Time(years) ranging form 0 – 25 years; 
- X4(weight): Weight(kg); 
- X5(fishmlwk): Fish meals consumed per week ranging from 0 - 21;
- X6(fishpart): Parts of fish consumed, indicate variable with 4 levels, 0 indicates not eating fish, 1 indicates muscle tissue only, 2 indicates muscle tissue and sometimes whole fish and 3 indicates whole fish; 
- X7(height): Height(cm). 

  Before analysis, I think fishmlwk and fishpart will directly affect TotHg in the hair. Also, fisherman will show more TotHg in the hair than non-fisherman. Weight, height, age and restime might be the factors of TotHg.
The main analysis for the **regression model** is **hypothesis test** and **ANOVA**. I will conduct the inference test from **SLR** to **MLR** to improve the model to a better **reduced model**.
